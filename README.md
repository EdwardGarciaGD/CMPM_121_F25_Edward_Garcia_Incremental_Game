# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This project is an incremental game with a Cartoon Network Chowder theme that the player can bake burple nurples like Chowder.
There are upgrades that the player can purchase to increase the counter.
Several new coding designs were added to help learn more about and provide experience.
TypeScript is a variation of JavaScript that was new to me.
Typeface was first used in my experience.
Refactoring skills were practiced during making this project.

Credits to Cartoon Network and Cartoon Network's Chowder.
Creator of Chowder: C.H. Greenblatt
